# VersionOne SDK.NET APIClient #

The APIClient provides access to the Core API without concern for the underlying RESTful API or the HTTP/XML plumbing. Through the APIClient, developers can query for simple or complex sets of information, update the information, and execute system-defined operations. The APIClient is best suited for course-grained and bulk access.
