# VersionOne SDK.NET APIClient

The APIClient provides access to the Core API without concern for the underlying RESTful API or the HTTP/XML plumbing. Through the APIClient, developers can query for simple or complex sets of information, update the information, and execute system-defined operations. The APIClient is best suited for course-grained and bulk access.

## System Requirements
These libraries have only been tested in a Windows environment with .NET Framework 4.5. They have not been tested under Mono.



## How to get the library as a precompiled package

_Do this if you only want to use the functionality, but are not interested in compiling from source or in contributing code to the project._

Use the NuGet package manager from Visual Studio or nuget.exe. Search for `VersionOne.SDK.NET.APIClient` to find the precompiled package. VersionOne tests packages distributed via NuGet against product releases as they become available. For details, see [the specific versions tested](https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.NET.APIClient/wiki/Which-product-releases-has-the-APIClient-library-been-tested-against%3F). Learn more about NuGet from [the NuGet Overview](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/overview).

## How to get the library source code

_Do this if you want to compile, customize, investigate, debug, or contribute code to the project._

***Important Note:  After cloning the github repository, type "build.sh" in your git bash command prompt to run the build script.  This will update all the necessary dependencies so that the project will compile properly.
