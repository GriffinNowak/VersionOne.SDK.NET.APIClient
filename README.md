The APIClient provides access to the Core API without concern for the underlying RESTful API or the HTTP/XML plumbing. Through the APIClient, developers can query for simple or complex sets of information, update the information, and execute system-defined operations. The APIClient is best suited for course-grained and bulk access.

This product includes software developed at VersionOne (http://versionone.com/). This product is open source and is licensed under a modified BSD license, which reflects our intent that software built with a dependency on the VersionOne SDK.NET APIClient can be commercial or open source, as the authors see fit.
